Maintenance and repairs are frequently necessary in hostels. The current process of requesting a repair or maintenance is quite tedious in 
MIT. There are delays and time issues for students. An application for this purpose would be of great help.
This project aims to automate this process of getting the repairs done in a hassle-free way. The application can be used by the student to
send a repair request to the hostel management. The hostel management can process this request and then send the appropriate person to
perform the necessary repairs at a time convenient to the student. The handyman can then send the report to the hostel management upon
completion of the task. This is in turn approved by the student.
